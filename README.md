# sopel-pronouns

Pronoun-sharing plugin for Sopel IRC bots

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-pronouns
```

## Configuring

The easiest way to configure `sopel-pronouns` is via Sopel's
configuration wizardâ€”simply run `sopel-plugins configure pronouns`
and enter the values for which it prompts you.

Options are:

* `fetch_complete_list`: Whether to download the complete list of supported
  pronoun sets at startup
  * `fetch_url`: An optional custom fetch URL for the complete list (see below)
* `link_base_url`: An optional custom base URL for links in the plugin's output

The `link_base_url` option allows you to use your own domain to host your own
instance of [our pronoun service][pronoun-service] hosted at
[`pronouns.sopel.chat`][pronouns-instance], which is itself a fork of Lucas
Eduardo's [lovely little Svelte project][original-pronoun-service].

If you want to customize the available pronoun sets, set the `fetch_url` to your
own instance's `pronouns.tab` file or an equivalent tab-delimited data source.
